## Configuration Files
- `configuration.yaml` - The file includes integration with a variety of smart devices and services. I've set up integrations with smart lighting, climate control (thermostats, ACs), media devices, and security sensors. The configurations are optimized for low-latency and high reliability, leveraging the power of Home Assistant Yellow.
  
- `automations.yaml` - Within this, you'll find automation rules that control lighting based on motion and time of day, adjust the thermostat for energy savings, manage media playback for routines (like morning news or bedtime music), and send notifications for security alerts.
  
- `scenes.yaml` - This file creates perfect settings for activities like "Dinner Time" where the lights dim and soft music plays, or "Work Mode" where the lights are bright and the climate is cool.
